Machine Learning Project Environment Setup

Objective: Set up a simple ML project environment using Python virtual environments, manage dependencies with requirements.txt, verify installation in a Jupyter Notebook, and push to GitHub.

1. Setup Directory and Virtual Environment

Create Project Directory:

mkdir ml-project
cd ml-project


Install Virtual Environment Tools (if missing):

sudo apt install python3-venv


Create and Activate Virtual Environment:

# Create virtual env named 'myenv'
python3 -m venv myenv

# Activate it
source myenv/bin/activate


You should see (myenv) appear at the start of your command prompt.

2. Create Requirements File

Create a file to list your project dependencies.

gedit requirements.txt


Content for requirements.txt:

numpy>=1.22
pandas>=1.5
jupyterlab>=4.1
notebook>=6.5
ipykernel


Save and close the file.

3. Install Dependencies

Install the libraries listed in your requirements file using pip.

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Verify in Jupyter Notebook

Launch Jupyter Lab:

jupyter lab


This will open a tab in your web browser.

Create a Notebook:

In the browser, click on the Notebook (Python 3) icon.

In the first cell, enter the following code to verify versions:

import sys
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

print("System Version:", sys.version)
print("Numpy Version:", np.__version__)
print("Pandas Version:", pd.__version__)


Run the Cell: Press Shift + Enter. You should see the version numbers printed below the cell.

5. Push to GitHub

Initialize Git:

Stop Jupyter Lab (Ctrl+C in terminal) if it's still running.

Initialize and commit:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "First commit: ML Setup"


Push to New Repository:

Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., ml-project).

Run the commands shown by GitHub:

git branch -M main
git remote add origin <Your-New-Repo-URL>
git push -u origin main
