Task 3: CI with Jenkins & GitHub

Objective: Create a "Student Portal" website and set up Jenkins to automatically build/test the project whenever changes are pushed to GitHub.

1. Install & Run Jenkins (If not installed)

If Jenkins is not installed via apt, you can run it using the WAR file (as shown in the video).

# 1. Install Java (Required)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jre -y

# 2. Download Jenkins WAR file
wget [https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.452.2/jenkins.war](https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.452.2/jenkins.war)

# 3. Run Jenkins
java -jar jenkins.war


Wait until you see "Jenkins is fully up and running". Access Jenkins at http://localhost:8080.

2. Unlock & Configure Jenkins

Unlock: Copy the initial admin password from the terminal logs (or /root/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword) and paste it into the browser.

Plugins: Select "Install suggested plugins".

User: Create your admin user account.

3. GitHub Project Setup

Create a Repo: Create a repository named StudentPortal on GitHub.

Clone & Add Content:

git clone <Your-StudentPortal-Repo-URL>
cd StudentPortal
gedit index.html


Add some simple HTML content to index.html.

Push to GitHub:

git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


4. Configure Jenkins Job

New Item: Click New Item on Jenkins dashboard.

Name: Student-Portal-Build -> Select Freestyle project -> OK.

Source Code Management:

Select Git.

Repository URL: Paste your GitHub repo URL.

Credentials: Click Add -> Jenkins.

Kind: Username with password.

Username: Your GitHub Username.

Password: Your Personal Access Token (PAT).

ID: jenkins-test (or any name).

Select these credentials from the dropdown.

Branch Specifier: */main.

Build Triggers:

Check Poll SCM.

Schedule: * * * * * (This checks for changes every minute).

Build Steps:

Add build step -> Execute Shell.

Command:

echo "Starting Student Portal Jenkins Build"
echo "Build Time: "
date
echo "Current Directory: "
pwd
echo "Listing files:"
ls -l
echo "Build Successfully Done"


Save the configuration.

5. Test the Automation

Modify Code: Open index.html locally and make a small change (e.g., add <h2>Jenkins CI Test</h2>).

Push:

git add .
git commit -m "Updated for CI"
git push origin main


Verify:

Go to your Jenkins Project page.

Wait approx. 1 minute. You should see a new build appear in Build History (flashing).

Click the build number -> Console Output.

You should see "Build Successfully Done" and "Finished: SUCCESS".
